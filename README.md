# cored.in

cored.in is a professional SocialFi app empowered with self-sovereign identity.

## Quick Start Notes

1.  Run `yarn && yarn build` to install all the dependencies and `yarn prepare` to setup Typia validation library (only first time)
2.  Run `yarn back-dev` to start your BackEnd dev environment (make sure to copy packages/backend/secrets-backend-local.json.example as secrets-backend-local.json)
3.  Run `yarn front-dev` to start your FrontEnd dev environment (make sure to copy packages/frontend/.env.example as .env.json)
OR
2. Run `yarn dev` to start both back and front dev environments

## Database
This project uses a posgreSQL DB, one sample instance could be run with `docker compose up -d postgres` inside packages/backend.

It can then be accessed directly with `psql -U dev_user -h localhost -p 5432 -d coredin_dev_db`.

Migrations can be generated from backend package with `yarn typeorm:generate db/migrations/<Migration description>` and ran with `yarn typeorm:migrate`.
