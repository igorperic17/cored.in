## Our Technology

### Built on Coreum
cored.in is built on top of the Cosmos ecosystem, leveraging Coreum, a Smart-Contract proof-of-stake blockchain. Coreum serves as the core infrastructure for future decentralized applications and DeFi.

### Soulbound Subscriptions
Profile subscriptions are represented by soulbound non-fungible tokens (NFTs) minted on demand. Users can set a price for their subscriptions, automatically paid by the subscriber upon minting.

### Verifiable Credentials
By leveraging the open-source SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) technology from walt.id, each profile is backed by a DID (Decentralized Identifier). Claims are based on verifiable credentials with cryptographic proof of the information issuer, ensuring authenticity. These can be issued directly within the platform or imported from existing SSI standards.

## Roadmap

### Profile Registration
Users can create a cored.in profile and generate a DID by connecting their Keplr wallet on the Coreum chain, which is then registered on-chain.

### Subscription-based Verifiable Claims
Profiles on cored.in are enriched with verifiable credentials, allowing users to choose between public, anonymized, or private visibility for their content. Hidden information and claim verification are disclosed only to profile subscribers, who may optionally pay for access.

### Incentivized Messaging
To prevent spam, cored.in users can request upfront payment before being contacted, ensuring mutual interest in the conversation.

### Talent Hunting
Find your next dream job or the best team for your project. With cored.in, you can verify the candidate and the employer's background, ensuring a fully transparent and trustworthy recruitment process.
